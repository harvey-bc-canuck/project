This repository demonstrates the process of forking, updating file structures, and managing Conda environments.

## Key Steps Taken:
- Forked the repository from: https://github.com/yuliaUU/files_to_copy.
- Reorganized the file structure to meet the project requirements:
  - Created folders for `data`, `docs`, `images`, `src`, and `reports`.
  - Moved files into their appropriate directories.
- Created a Conda environment.
- Exported the Conda environment to an `environment.yaml` file for easy replication.
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files (e.g., `__pycache__`, `.DS_Store`, `.ipynb_checkpoints`).
